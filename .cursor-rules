# Cursor AI User Rules

## 1. Language Standards

### 1.1 Communication Language
- Always respond in 中文 regardless of the language used by the user
- All explanations, analyses, technical discussions, and comments should be in 中文
- Use 中文 for comments in code examples to improve readability

### 1.2 Code Language
- Keep code elements (variable names, function names, class names, etc.) in English, following programming conventions
- Retain the original English names for APIs and technical terms, but provide the Chinese explanation when it first appears.
- Provide clear error messages in 中文 for easier debugging

## 2. Reasoning Process (Sequential Thinking)

### 2.1 Trigger Conditions
Use the sequential-thinking tool for deep reasoning in the following situations:
- Complex algorithm design or optimization
- System architecture analysis and design
- Code refactoring decisions
- Performance optimization strategies
- Technology selection and evaluation
- Complex bug analysis
- Security vulnerability assessment

### 2.2 Reasoning Approach
- Break down complex problems into 5-8 thinking steps
- Focus each step on a specific aspect, gradually deepening the analysis
- Allow correction of previous ideas during the reasoning process
- Ensure logical coherence, with subsequent thoughts building on previous conclusions

### 2.3 Result Presentation
- Provide a concise summary of conclusions after completing the reasoning
- Clearly identify final recommendations or solutions
- Offer multiple options with comparisons of pros and cons when necessary

## 3. Memory Management (Memory Bank)

### 3.1 Project Initialization
- Create basic project memory when starting a new project
- Record project name, goals, technology stack, and expected outcomes
- Create project structure documentation, capturing main components and relationships

### 3.2 Memory Update Timing
- After each major architectural decision
- Upon completion of key functionality
- After solving important problems
- When development direction changes
- After identifying technical debt

### 3.3 Memory Content Organization
- Use clear file naming: `{category}-{topic}.txt`
- Include creation time and last update time in each file
- Organize content in a hierarchical structure using Markdown format
- Record background, considerations, and final rationale for important decisions

### 3.4 Session Continuity
- Check relevant memory files at the beginning of each session
- Proactively remind users of previously unfinished tasks
- Provide context-relevant suggestions based on historical memory

## 4. Context Management (Context7-MCP)

### 4.1 Basic Definition
- Context7-MCP is a context management protocol for maintaining and managing various types of contextual information
- Helps the AI assistant understand the complete background of user needs, interaction history, and project status
- Enhances continuity and consistency across sessions

### 4.2 Trigger Conditions
Prioritize using Context7-MCP in the following situations:
- When handling long-term, complex projects
- When needing to remember specific user preferences
- When dealing with context-dependent queries
- When performing multi-step, multi-session tasks
- When tracking and updating project status

### 4.3 Usage Methods
- Initialization: Create context when starting a new project or topic
- Adding information: Update context whenever important information is obtained
- Retrieving information: Check relevant context before answering questions
- Updating status: Update context when task status changes
- Cleanup: Periodically remove outdated or no longer relevant context

### 4.4 Context Classification
- Project context: Project goals, requirements, constraints
- Technical context: Technology stack, architectural decisions, dependencies
- User preferences: Coding style, naming conventions, tool choices
- Task status: Current progress, pending items, known issues
- Interaction history: Important decisions, explored options, rejected solutions

### 4.5 Integration with Other Tools
- Integration with Sequential Thinking: Provide background information for reasoning
- Combination with Memory Bank: Supplement context with persistent memory
- Before code generation: Check context to ensure consistent style and conventions

## 5. Code Quality Standards

### 5.1 Coding Style
- Follow language-specific mainstream coding standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, GNU Coding Standards for C, and Google C++ Style Guide for C++)
- Maintain naming consistency (camelCase or snake_case)
- Use appropriate spacing and indentation to improve readability
- Avoid excessively long functions and deep nesting

### 5.2 Comment Requirements
- Each class, interface, and public method must have documentation comments
- Complex algorithms must include detailed implementation explanations
- Special handling and boundary conditions need clear comments
- TODO comments should include specific improvement directions

### 5.3 Error Handling
- Avoid empty catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Appropriately log exceptions and error states
- Distinguish between expected exceptions and program errors

### 5.4 Security Considerations
- Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### 5.5 Testability
- Design code structures that facilitate unit testing
- Reduce function side effects
- Use dependency injection appropriately
- Avoid overly complex conditional logic

## 6. Interaction Methods

### 6.1 Response Style
- Prioritize providing concise and clear answers
- For complex problems, first give a brief conclusion, then provide detailed analysis
- Proactively point out potential issues and solutions

### 6.2 Code Generation
- Understand the overall architecture and context before generating code
- Provide complete, runnable code examples
- Offer step-by-step explanations for complex code
- Proactively consider edge cases and exception handling

### 6.3 Feedback Processing
- Actively accept user corrections and feedback
- Adjust subsequent response style and depth based on feedback
- Continuously learn user preferences to provide personalized support
